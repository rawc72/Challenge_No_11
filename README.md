# 11 Express.js: Note Taker

## User Story and functionality:
As a small business owner, I want to be able to write and save my notes so that I can organize my thoughts and keep track of tasks I need to complete. With this in mind, this application functions as a Note Taker that can be used to write and save notes. This application will use an Express.js back end and will save and retrieve note data from a JSON file.


## User experience:
When I open the Note Taker application, I am presented with a landing page with a link to a notes page. When I click on the link to the notes page, then I am presented with a page with existing notes listed in the left-hand column, plus empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column.

When I enter a new note title and the note’s text, then a Save icon appears in the navigation at the top of the page. When I click on the Save icon, then the new note I have entered is saved and appears in the left-hand column with the other existing notes.

When I click on an existing note in the list in the left-hand column, then that note appears in the right-hand column. When I click on the Write icon in the navigation at the top of the page, then I am presented with empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column.
